                for life, growing in our faith, and touring our nation's capital. The whole thing is happening

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">
              The March for Life is the largest pro-life event in the world. It started in 1974 as a response to 
              the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, which struck down laws against abortion in the
              United States.
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">
              Since then the March has grown into a celebration of what Pope John Paul II called "the culture of
              life." Every year tens of thousands of people gather to commit themselves to justice for 
              all&mdash;born and unborn.
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">
              The March for life is also a great opportunity for teenagers to grow in their faith. They get to 
              see the Church in all its vibrancy: from the vigil Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of
              the Immaculate Conception to the Youth Rally at the Capital One Center to the March itself, teenagers
              get to see others like themselves deepining their relationship with Christ and working for justice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">
              We will also take some time to take in the city. We will get to see the monuments on the Mall 
              by moonlight, tour Georgetown, and explore the Holocaust Museum as well as the Smithsonians.

            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left">
              <strong>Cost.</strong> The cost for attending the March for Life is <strong>$60 per person</strong>. 
              This price includes food. (Though we do ask that you either pack a lunch or bring money for a meal on
              the way down to D.C. on Thursday). We highly encourage you to bring at least a little spending
              money. We are budgeting $10 per meal, and you might wish to spend more. You might also wish to 
              make a few incidental purchases along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left">
              <strong>What to Bring.</strong> To cut down on costs, we will be sleeping in sleeping bags in the 
              a parish hall. (Don't worry, men and women will have separate accommodations). So, 
              you will need to bring toiletries, overnight clothes, a pillow, and a sleeping bag. Also bring something
              to keep you busy on the bus, but don't bring a lot of extra stuff: due to security, many of the event
              locations limit the kind of bag you can bring to one small drawstring bag.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left">
              <strong>Cold Weather.</strong> January in D.C. can be pretty cold, and we will be spending a lot of
              time outside on Friday. So, make sure you wear plenty of layered clothing, because if you do not, you
              <i>will</i> get cold. <a href="http://studentsforlife.org/how-to-dress-for-the-march/">Here are some tips</a>

              <strong>Cardinal Mooney Students.</strong> You can sign up outside the chapel or in your theology class.
              You can also talk to either Dr. Mattiussi or Fr. Peter to sign up. Payment is not due when you sign up,
              and permission slips will be handed out at a later date, as the March approaches. If you cannot pay the
              $60, then contact either Dr. Mattiussi and Fr. Peter, because financial aid is available.

              <strong>Other Students.</strong> Although Cardinal Mooney High School is sponsoring the trip, we are

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">
              The March for Life and all of the events that surround it provide a great opportunity for our students
              to grow in their faith. For three whole days they are surrounded by joyful young people, as well as 
              priests, religious, and seminarians. They get to see the vibrancy of our Church, participate in worship,
              and take ownership of their faith. In order to make this happen, we are appealing to the Mooney Family
              and to the broader community to help us defray some of the cost for attending this trip. Your donation
              will help to cover the cost of transportation, room, and board. The students will be picking up the 
              remaining costs. We hope to use this trip as a springboard to make our pro-life witness and strong
              Catholic identity at Cardinal Mooney even better. Will you help us . . .
